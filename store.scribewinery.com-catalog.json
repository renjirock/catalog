The earth is very well drained and contains various salts and minerals, rich in potassium. The climate is temperate and the air extremely pure and uncontaminated.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>FARMING:<\/strong> The terrain is fertilised to the perfect amount, cleared of all weeds and aerated. The vines themselves are pruned accurately and fixed to the wires in an orderly manner, leaving more than enough space for growth.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>ABOUT the PRODUCER:<\/strong> Mancini is a family owned and operated winery in Gallura, Sardinia, that started back in the 70s by Piero. As his passion for wine-making grew, so did the number of selected vines he was able to cultivate. It was clear to him that the all important trifecta of climate-terrain-vine was the basis of creating grapes of the highest quality, which, at the same time, could encompass the characteristics and the uniqueness of the place of origin.<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;><strong>PRODUCTION NOTES from the Importer, Oliver McCrum: <\/strong>&#38;quot;Mancini&#38;#39;s version of the grape is very fresh and forward, made with no oak or malolactic fermentation, just grapejuice fermented at low temperature in stainless steel for the aromas.&#38;quot;<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;><strong>TASTING NOTES\/PAIRING Suggestions from OM:<\/strong> &#38;quot;Pale yellow color; aroma of peach, tangerine and herbs; medium-weight in the mouth, with bright acidity; very clean, good length, finishes with a touch of tangerine.

The many recipes are enhanced by the author&#38;#39;s knowledge of early California lore and recollections of meals at her family&#38;#39;s Rancho... <strong>The tradition of great early California cuisine was handed down from mother to daughter, from cook to cook.<\/strong> Jacqueline was lucky to have her grandmother, her mother, aunts and uncles to help her find just the right chile, just the right herb, as she recreated the favorite rancho dishes -- recipes and menus for festival days as well as &#38;quot;the quiet days of the week.&#38;quot; Together, they tested each dish until it met with unanimous approval. What really is the extraordinary food of early California? It is a blench of cuisines, of tastes both earthy and sophisticated. It is not just Mexican food carried across the border. Nor is it just Spanish food adapted to another region. Nor is it Indian food with Spanish names. Early California food owed a debt to the Mission padres who brought grapevines and olive trees from Spain, and to the countryside itself for the indigenous offerings of purslane, cactus joints and wild mustard. <strong>CALIFORNIA RANCHO presents a style of food that is part of our American heritage -- and of California, past and present.&#38;quot;&#38;nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<address>Scribe chefs, Kelly Mariani and Emma Lipp&#38;#39;s, favorite recipes from this book are&#38;nbsp;&#38;quot;Rancho Sarsa&#38;quot; (Salsa) on page 22,&#38;nbsp;&#38;quot;Mostaza, or Wild Mustard greens,&#38;quot; page 82, and &#38;quot;Grandma&#38;#39;s Spanish Rice,&#38;quot; on page 152.<\/address>\n\n<address>&#38;nbsp;<\/address>\n\n<p><strong>To ensure delivery by&#38;nbsp;Friday, 12\/21, please submit all out-of-state orders by&#38;nbsp;12\/12 &#38;amp; a<\/strong><strong>ll California orders by&#38;nbsp;12\/18<\/strong>.&#38;nbsp;Email <a href=&#34;mailto:shipping@scribewinery.com&#34;>shipping@scribewinery.com<\/a> with any additional delivery-related inquiries.&#38;nbsp;<\/p>","price":185,"image_link":"http:\/\/store.scribewinery.com\/assets\/images\/products\/pictures\/HaciendaKitchenKit.4.jpg","link":"http:\/\/store.scribewinery.com\/product\/california-cooking-kit","inventory_quantity":0,"display_website":true,"brand":"Scribe Winery","type":"","varietal":""},{"id":"010eab78-c2a8-186b-6e1c-6e4c4243db7d","sku":"BK-California","title":"California Rancho Cooking","description":"","price":30,"image_link":"","link":"http:\/\/store.scribewinery.com\/product\/california-rancho-cooking","inventory_quantity":0,"display_website":true,"brand":"","type":"","varietal":""},{"id":"354ef5cc-9e6d-3135-53f6-5a8531671e63","sku":"CAMCB","title":"Camino Cook Book","description":"","price":35,"image_link":"http:\/\/store.scribewinery.com\/assets\/images\/products\/pictures\/ScreenShot2016-08-28at10.10.39AM.png","link":"http:\/\/store.scribewinery.com\/product\/camino-cook-book","inventory_quantity":0,"display_website":true,"brand":"","type":"","varietal":""},{"id":"0491f647-ff43-85cd-006b-6e9e7a7468e3","sku":"CH-PK2020","title":"Chardonnay Holiday Selection","description":"<address><br \/>\nOrders with 4 or more bottles receive FREE SHIPPING.<br \/>\n&#38;nbsp;<\/address>\n\n<p>Celebrate the holidays with <strong>a lineup of our Chardonnay bottlings<\/strong>, including the 2016 Sparkling Chardonnay, which is perfect for popping open over Christmas dinner or for ringing in the New Year.&#38;nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Includes:<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>(1) 2014 SCRIBE Sparkling Chardonnay \/ 750mL<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>(1) 2018 SCRIBE Skin Fermented Chardonnay \/ 500mL<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>(1) 2018 SCRIBE&#38;nbsp; Carneros Chardonnay \/ 750mL<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>(1) 2018 SCRIBE Estate Chardonnay\/ 750mL<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>To ensure delivery by Tuesday, 12\/24<\/strong>, please submit all out-of-state orders by <strong>Monday, 12\/14<\/strong>&#38;nbsp;and all California orders by <strong>Monday, 12\/21<\/strong>.

Dinner at the Hac will be served State Bird Provisions and The Progress-style, starting with dim-sum appetizers followed by a Progress-style course, paired with SCRIBE wines.<\/p>\n\n<p>Bring your friends, your family, and cheers to the new year ahead.<\/p>\n\n<p>While we are unable to accommodate any food preferences, please inform us of any food allergies you may have.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Tickets are $225 per person and include dinner, wine, tax and gratuity.&#38;nbsp;<\/strong>Capacity is limited.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>TO PURCHASE TICKETS<\/strong>, add this event to your cart and check out. <strong>TICKETS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<address>&#38;nbsp;<\/address>\n\n<address><u><em><strong>SCRIBE Hacienda<\/strong><\/em><\/u><br \/>\n2100 Denmark Street<br \/>\nSonoma, CA 95476<br \/>\n707.939.1858<\/address>\n\n<p>&#38;nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;\/assets\/client\/Image\/SVSMAY2016\/Duallogo.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 400px; height: 93px;&#34; \/><\/p>\n\n<address><img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;\/assets\/client\/Image\/scribe140.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px; height: 450px;&#34; \/><\/address>\n\n<address><img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;\/assets\/client\/Image\/scribe076.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px; height: 450px;&#34; \/><\/address>\n\n<address><img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;\/assets\/client\/Image\/NOV2018\/_K4A4719.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px; height: 200px;&#34; \/><\/address>\n\n<address><img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;\/assets\/client\/Image\/scribe109.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px; height: 450px;&#34; \/><\/address>\n\n<address><img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;\/assets\/client\/Image\/NOV2018\/scribe071.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px; height: 450px;&#34; \/><\/address>","price":225,"image_link":"http:\/\/store.scribewinery.com\/assets\/images\/products\/pictures\/ScreenShot2018-12-18at3.21.58PM.png","link":"http:\/\/store.scribewinery.com\/product\/dinner-at-the-hacienda-with-state-bird-provisions-+-the-progress-(sat)","inventory_quantity":0,"display_website":true,"brand":"Scribe Winery","type":"","varietal":""},{"id":"1ea584cb-f6bb-8e2c-f6b3-e83b170ab02d","sku":"16DONATION","title":"Donation Wine","description":"","price":0,"image_link":"","link":"http:\/\/store.scribewinery.com\/product\/donation-wine","inventory_quantity":0,"display_website":true,"brand":"","type":"","varietal":""},{"id":"7438fbc0-f5ab-2fcb-6897-0404d1adc993","sku":"SVSCANCEL","title":"Early SVS Termination - Retail Wine Difference","description":"","price":0,"image_link":"","link":"http:\/\/store.scribewinery.com\/product\/early-svs-termination---retail-wine-difference","inventory_quantity":0,"display_website":true,"brand":"Scribe Winery","type":"","varietal":""},{"id":"ae3d038f-959a-1226-e068-0fe7f0b4f464","sku":"Eastereggs","title":"Easter Eggs","description":"","price":6,"image_link":"http:\/\/store.scribewinery.com\/assets\/images\/products\/pictures\/20142F042F162Ff02Feasteregg.ff337-670x3301.jpg","link":"http:\/\/store.scribewinery.com\/product\/easter-eggs","inventory_quantity":0,"display_website":true,"brand":"Scribe Winery","type":"","varietal":""},{"id":"0be950d2-f4ab-cec1-48b5-ddb79224c06f","sku":"PN-PK2022","title":"Estate Pinot Noir Libary Vertical","description":"<p>We&#38;rsquo;re opening the SCRIBE Cellar with a trio of Pinot Noirs from the Scribe Estate, hand-selected from the library by Adam and Andrew Mariani.&#38;nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>2013 SCRIBE Estate Pinot Noir<br \/>\nII.

After a 100% carbonic fermentation with native yeast, we bottle the wine unfined, unfiltered and without sulfur.

The third, Reinke vineyard, lies a little further east on Bressa-Dibble clay loam.

In homage, we planted our Riesling vines in 2007 on a southwest-facing slope of Arrowhead Mountain.<\/p>\n\n<p>The 2016 vintage of our SCRIBE Estate Riesling is already proving to be a superb expression of the varietal. A warm winter encouraged an early growing season, with favorable temperatures from budbreak to harvest that produced a beautifully-balanced vintage. The grapes were harvested on August 18th, 20th, 22nd &#38;amp; 26th at 19.5 Brix, fermented in 50% stainless steel and 50% concrete for 60 days and aged on the lees until bottling on January 11, 2017. <strong>860 Cases.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The Riesling Release Dinner is Ned&#38;#39;s first visit to the SCRIBE farm, and we are thrilled to have him cook for us at the Hacienda. In 2015, Ned opened Houseman restaurant in NYC, inspired by the Swedish concept of&#38;nbsp;<em>husmanskost<\/em>, or &#38;quot;everyday food.&#38;quot; Rooted in the classics of comfort and tradition, Ned cooks in a direct manner conducive to the simple enjoyment of eating. Equally inspired by the unexpected as by the everyday, he brings his straightforward, yet contemporary, cooking style to pair with an evening celebrating our take on the noble German varietal.<\/p>\n\n<p>Come toast the release of the <strong>2016 SCRIBE Estate Riesling<\/strong> with this special dinner at the SCRIBE Hacienda.&#38;nbsp;<strong>Tickets are $135 per person and include dinner, wine, tax and gratuity.&#38;nbsp;<\/strong>Capacity is limited.&#38;nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Dinner attendees will have first access to the new release wines before they are otherwise available for purchase online or in person.&#38;nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>TO PURCHASE TICKETS<\/strong>, add this event to your cart and check out.&#38;nbsp;<strong>TICKETS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>While we are unable to accommodate any food preferences, please inform us of any food allergies you may have.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><u><strong>SCRIBE Hacienda<\/strong><\/u><br \/>\n2100 Denmark Street<br \/>\nSonoma, CA 95476<br \/>\n707.939.1858<\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n&#38;nbsp;<\/p>","price":135,"image_link":"http:\/\/store.scribewinery.com\/assets\/images\/products\/pictures\/NEDEVENT.jpg","link":"http:\/\/store.scribewinery.com\/product\/zzzold!!2016-riesling-release-dinner-with-houseman","inventory_quantity":14,"display_website":true,"brand":"Scribe Winery","type":"","varietal":""},{"id":"12273cc9-c220-5554-12a8-a99742db2324","sku":"HAC-SpReleaseDinST.Lau+Colu-MAR2017","title":"zzzOLD!!2016 ST.

A warm winter encouraged an early growing season, with favorable temperatures from budbreak to harvest that produced an exquisitely-balanced vintage. The grapes were harvested on August 18th &#38;amp; 27th at 18 Brix, fermented in stainless steel for 55 days and aged on the lees until bottling on January 11, 2017. <strong>559 Cases<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Sylvaner Release Dinner marks Danny Newberg&#38;#39;s return to the SCRIBE farm, and his first culinary venture in the Hacienda kitchen (although his love for live fire cooking may still take him outside). Through <a href=&#34;https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/the-perpetual-pop-up-a-dining-trend-digs-in-1487699461?mobile=y&#34;>Joint Venture<\/a>, Danny emphasizes a unique, collaborative dining experience that conveys the best expression of place and season. His nomadic approach has gained him entrance to friend&#38;#39;s kitchens across the world, and since 2014 has provided inspiration for Joint Venture&#38;#39;s eclectic style. Elements of his travels in Asia, his love of Mexico, a childhood spent on fishing boats and an insatiability for live fire all turn up in his cooking.&#38;nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Come toast the release of the <strong>2016 SCRIBE Estate Sylvaner<\/strong> with this special dinner at the SCRIBE Hacienda.&#38;nbsp;<strong>Tickets are $135 per person and include dinner, wine, tax and gratuity.<\/strong>&#38;nbsp;Capacity is limited.&#38;nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Dinner attendees will have first access to the new release wines before they are otherwise available for purchase online or in person.&#38;nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>TO PURCHASE TICKETS<\/strong>, add this event to your cart and check out. <strong>TICKETS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>While we are unable to accommodate any food preferences, please inform us of any food allergies you may have.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<address><u><strong>SCRIBE Hacienda<\/strong><\/u><br \/>\n2100 Denmark Street<br \/>\nSonoma, CA 95476<br \/>\n707.939.1858<\/address>\n\n<address>&#38;nbsp;<\/address>\n\n<p>&#38;nbsp;<\/p>","price":135,"image_link":"http:\/\/store.scribewinery.com\/assets\/images\/products\/pictures\/DANNYEVENT.jpg","link":"http:\/\/store.scribewinery.com\/product\/zzzold!!2016-sylvaner-release-dinner-with-joint-venture","inventory_quantity":11,"display_website":true,"brand":"Scribe Winery","type":"","varietal":""},{"id":"6f5acbb7-b7f2-502d-b0c9-948908b90adc","sku":"HAC-DinnerwithChris-FEB2018","title":"zzzOLD!!Dinner at the Hacienda with Chris Fischer","description":"<p><strong><span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;>IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED TO THE WAITLIST, PLEASE EMAIL SVS@SCRIBEWINERY.COM.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;>SATURDAY, February 17th, 2018<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;>Starts at 6:30pm<br \/>\nReservations Required.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>On Saturday, February 17th,<\/strong>&#38;nbsp;our<b> <\/b>longtime friend and collaborator,&#38;nbsp;<strong>Chris Fischer <\/strong>of <strong><a href=&#34;https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/explore\/locations\/22862280\/beetlebung-farm\/&#34;>BEETLEBUNG FARM<\/a>,<a href=&#34;http:\/\/theprogress-sf.com\/home\/&#34;>&#38;nbsp;<\/a><\/strong>returns&#38;nbsp;as our next&#38;nbsp;<strong>Chef-in-Residence <\/strong>to cook&#38;nbsp;a special<strong>&#38;nbsp;ros&#38;eacute; release dinner at the Hacienda<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Celebrate the release of our<strong> <a href=&#34;http:\/\/store.scribewinery.com\/product\/2017-Ros--of-Pinot-Noir---Futures&#34;>2017 SCRIBE Ros&#38;eacute; of Pinot Noir<\/a><\/strong> with a prix-fixe dinner from the James Beard award-winning chef and cookbook author.

It was a privilege to pair our wines alongside Alice&#38;#39;s legendary cooking, and to share a place and a philosophy that has been such a guiding influence at SCRIBE. After a year paying tribute to the Bay Area classics it only seemed fitting to return to the source and pay homage&#38;nbsp;to a woman and a restaurant that defined New American cooking, and continues to influence future generations of talented chefs.<\/p>\n\n<p>We are excited to announce that Chez Panisse will host the SVS for our upcoming Harvest Allocation Release Dinner.&#38;nbsp;Join us in their downstairs restaurant on <strong>Thursday,&#38;nbsp;November 10th <\/strong>for a special four-course, prix fixe menu created for the SVS, each course to be paired with a featured SCRIBE wine, including our newest release, the 2016 SCRIBE Nouveau of Pinot Noir.<\/p>\n\n<p>Chez Panisse opened its doors in Berkeley, California in 1971, led by Alice Waters and a group of idealistic friends. The founding philosophy of the restaurant&#38;nbsp;has remained unchanged over the course of its four decades of influence: that food should be based on the finest and freshest of seasonal ingredients, produced sustainably and locally.<\/p>\n\n<p>While this ethos now pervades the culinary scene, Alice, inspired by her time in France and travels across Europe in the 60s, pioneered the concept stateside,&#38;nbsp;translating the French approach to cooking into the American standard for quality cuisine.
